## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js (version 18 or higher) installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm / Yarn**: Node.js installation usually includes npm. If you prefer Yarn, you can install it globally: `npm install -g yarn`.
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    First, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd aws-cloud-practitioner-prep
    ```
    Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate into the cloned project directory and install the necessary npm packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use Yarn
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables (Optional for current features):**
    This project currently uses local JSON files for quiz data and does not strictly require environment variables for its core functionality. However, if you plan to extend it with external services (e.g., databases, APIs), you would typically create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
    ```
    # Example environment variable
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
    Remember to never commit your `.env.local` file to version control.

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server and view the application:

```bash
npm run dev
# or if you use Yarn
yarn dev
```

The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production deployment:

```bash
npm run build
# or if you use Yarn
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized build of your application in the `.next` directory.

## Usage

*   **Home Page**: Provides an overview of the platform, key statistics, and links to modules and question sets.
